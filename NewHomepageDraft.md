**23.05.2009. Version 0.6 released**

Too many changes to list, please see the [changelog](changelog.md) for a full list of changes.

0.6 is now compatible with Hermes' cIOS, please install from [here](http://mplayer-ce.googlecode.com/files/hermes_cios_installer.dol) and follow the [installation instructions](USB20.md).

**Please note:** If you have installed a previous version of the USB 2.0 cIOS and are receiving a -1017 error when installing or it's hanging at downloading, you will have to use [Any Title Deleter](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/AnyTitle_Deleter/) and delete IOS202. _Be Careful_.

Following this, make sure you have deleted the 0000001 folder from your SD card and try again.

Mplayer-CE is a homebrew media player for the Nintendo Wii. It was initially created as a fork of the Team Twiizers MPlayer port, combining elements of MPlayerWii, GeeXboX and other great homebrew contributions. It is built with devkitPro development tools, fully homebrew driven and not associated with Nintendo in any way.

Some of the current features includes DVD, SDHC, USB 2.0 storage device support, multiple media, subtitle, playlist and streaming formats, customization possibilities, etc.

Find further information, setup and user guides within our [Wiki pages](http://code.google.com/p/mplayer-ce/w/list).

We hope you like it ;) Mplayer-CE Team.
